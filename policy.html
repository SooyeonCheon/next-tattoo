                Our age policy has recently changed, as per the requirements of our insurance providers. We tattoo at 18
                with valid government-issued photo ID. 16 and 17 year olds can get tattooed, however a legal guardian
                must be present to sign. Valid ID is required for both the client and guardian.

                All of our artists have experience with smaller script and symbol tattoos, and these can usually be
                booked without a consultation.We are a custom shop, meaning that our talented artists can take your
                ideas and turn them into your perfect tattoo. For larger and custom pieces, we recommend perusing our
                artists’ portfolios and booking a free consultation with the artist whose style best fits the design you
                have in mind.

                There is no legal age of consent for piercing in the province of British Columbia. According to shop
                policy, you must be at least 16 years of age to be pierced without parental consent and at least 18
                years of age for genital piercings. We require proof of age for all piercings. We accept parental
                consent for most piercings in person, with ID

            <div class="h3_title">About children’s piercing</div>
            <div class="h3_body">
                If you are bringing your child to get pierced, it is recommended that you give yourself plenty of time
                as sometimes little ones need a break between ears to muster up the courage for the second one. If your
                child has a favorite comfort toy or treat, it might be helpful to bring that along with you.
                We do not use piercing guns as they are unsanitary, prone to coming out crooked/uneven, cause
                unnecessary tissue damage, and the jewellery is not designed promote healing.
                We emphasize the importance of informed consent. We will not pierce anyone who is unable to communicate
                that they want this piercing and that they know it will hurt. If at any point your child changes their
                mind, we will respect their wishes. Piercings are a permanent cosmetic alteration to the body and no one
                but the owner of the body being pierced can consent to that. Because of our values we will, under no
                circumstances, pierce infants.
